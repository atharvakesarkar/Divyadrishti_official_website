**DivyaDrishti – See the Unseen, Breathe the Future**

DivyaDrishti is an innovative real-time pollution detecting system that leverages IoT and environmental technology to deliver accurate, affordable, and actionable insights. Built by student innovators, it aims to empower citizens, communities, schools, and authorities with transparent pollution data for smarter, healthier decisions.

**🌍 Problem Statement**

India ranks among the top 5 most polluted countries globally. In 2019 alone, 1.67 million lives were lost due to air pollution, causing strokes, heart attacks, and lung diseases.

**Key challenges:**

Vehicles: 32+ crore vehicles, but no real-time emissions data.

PUC testing: Happens only twice a year and is often faked.

Accident emissions: No checks after vehicle damage.

High costs: Industrial monitors cost ₹1.5 lakh+ per unit.

Scams: Cases like Volkswagen Dieselgate show how pollution reporting can be manipulated.

We are fighting a silent killer—without knowing exactly where the poison is coming from.

DivyaDrishti is a cost-effective IoT-based pollution detection device that:

Detects dust, harmful gases, and weather conditions in real-time.

Streams live data to an interactive dashboard with maps, graphs, and alerts.

Offers transparent, reliable data for citizens and policymakers.

Provides health insights and early warnings for high-risk zones.
